# Asynchronous Load Balancer
This project implements a load balancer in Python using asynchronous programming techniques and Docker containers to distribute incoming requests from multiple clients evenly among several servers. The load balancer helps in distributing the load across servers efficiently, ensuring optimal resource utilization and preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed.

# Features
* Asynchronously handles incoming requests from multiple clients.
* Distributes requests among multiple servers to evenly balance the load.
* Implemented using Python's asynchronous programming features.
* Docker containers for easy deployment and scalability.

# Usage 
1. Clone the repository 
2. Build docker images 
3. Start load balancer and servers
